# Event Handlers and Event Listeners

## Summary
This series of exercises is meant to stretch our knowledge of event listeners and event handlers used under different circumstances.
Each exercise asks the student to manipulate the DOM or use event listeners and functions to perform a specified action.  For example, the student must use specific events to trigger different pieces of text to appear in a targeted div in the DOM. In another case, the div output must mirror the actions of a user entering text in the text area.  Still other exercises encourage the student to research the differences between targeting elements by id versus tag name and use that information to alter style elements such as color and display or attach new classes to an element for styling.
